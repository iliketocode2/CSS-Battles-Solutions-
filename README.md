Solutions to these fun CSS puzzles I enjoy! You can find the daily challenge [here](https://cssbattle.dev/daily).

### My Strategy
- Write the CSS in a clear, standard format initially
- Combine similar <div> elements where possible
- Remove all whitespace and any non-essential characters that arenâ€™t required for the code to compile

### The Result
- Extremely compact (and nearly unreadable) CSS code!
